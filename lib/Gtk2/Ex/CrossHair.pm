=head1 NAME

Gtk2::Ex::CrossHair -- crosshair lines drawn following the mouse

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Gtk2::Ex::CrossHair;
 my $crosshair = Gtk2::Ex::CrossHair->new (widgets => [$w1,$w2]);
 $crosshair->signal_connect (moved => sub { ... });

 $crosshair->start ($event);
 $crosshair->end ();

=head1 OBJECT HIERARCHY

C<Gtk2::Ex::CrossHair> is a subclass of C<Glib::Object>.

    Glib::Object
      Gtk2::Ex::CrossHair

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A CrossHair object draws a horizontal and vertical line through the mouse
pointer position on top of one or more widgets' existing contents.  This is
intended as a visual guide for the user.

The idea is to help see relative positions.  For example in a graph the
horizontal line helps you see which of two peaks is the higher, and the
vertical line can extend down to (or into) an X axis scale to help see where
exactly a particular part of the graph lies.

The C<moved> callback lets you update a text status line with a position in
figures, etc (if you don't display something like that following the mouse
all the time).

While the crosshair is active the mouse cursor is set invisible in the
target windows, since the cross is enough feedback and a cursor tends to
obscure the lines.  This is done with the WidgetCursor mechanism (see
L<Gtk2::Ex::WidgetCursor>) and so cooperates with widget or application uses
of that.

The crosshair is drawn using xors in the widget window.  See
L<Gtk2::Ex::Xor> for notes on this.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=over 4

=item C<< Gtk2::Ex::CrossHair->new (key => value, ...) >>

Create and return a new CrossHair object.  Optional key/value pairs set
initial properties as per C<< Glib::Object->new >>.  Eg.

    my $ch = Gtk2::Ex::CrossHair->new (widgets => [ $widget ],
                                       foreground => 'orange');

=item C<< $crosshair->start () >>

=item C<< $crosshair->start ($event) >>

=item C<< $crosshair->end () >>

Start or end crosshair display.

For C<start> if the optional C<$event> is a C<Gtk2::Gdk::Event::Button> then
the crosshair is active as long as that button is pressed, otherwise for a
keypress, omitted, or C<undef> then the crosshair is active until explicitly
stopped with an C<end> call.

=head1 PROPERTIES

=over 4

=item C<active> (boolean)

True when the crosshair is to be drawn, moved, etc.  Turning this on or off
is the same as calling C<start> or C<end> above (except you can't pass a
button press event).

=item C<widgets> (array of C<Gtk2::Widget>)

An arrayref of widgets to draw on.  Often this will be just one widget, but
multiple widgets can be given to draw in them all at the same time.

=item C<widget> (C<Gtk2::Widget>)

A single widget to operate on.  The C<widget> and C<widgets> properties
access the same underlying set of widgets to operate on, you can set or get
whichever best suits.  But if there's more than one widget you can't get
from the single C<widget>.

=item C<foreground> (colour scalar, default undef)

The colour for the crosshair.  This can be

=over 4

=item *

A string colour name or #RGB form per C<< Gtk2::Gdk::Color->parse >>

=item *

A C<Gtk2::Gdk::Color> object.

=item *

C<undef> (the default) for the widget style C<fg> foreground colour (see
L<Gtk2::Style>).

=back

=back

=head1 SIGNALS

=over 4

=item moved (parameters: crosshair, widget, x, y, userdata)

Emitted when the crosshair moves to the given C<$widget> and X,Y coordinates
within that widget (widget relative coordinates).  C<$widget> is C<undef> if
the mouse moves outside any of the crosshair widgets.

It's worth noting a subtle difference in C<moved> reporting when a crosshair
is activated from a button or from the keyboard.  A button press causes an
implicit grab and all events are reported to that window.  C<moved> gives
that widget and an X,Y position possibly outside its window area
(eg. negatives).  But for a keyboard or programmatic start C<moved> reports
the widget currently containing the mouse, or C<undef> when not in any.
Usually the button press grab is good thing, it means a dragged button keeps
reporting about its original window.

=back

=head1 BUGS

C<no-window> widgets don't work properly, but instead should be put in a
C<Gtk2::EventBox> and that passed to the crosshair.
