=head1 NAME

Gtk2::Ex::Lasso -- drag the mouse to lasso a rectangular region

=for test_synopsis my ($widget, $event)

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Gtk2::Ex::Lasso;
 my $lasso = Gtk2::Ex::Lasso->new (widget => $widget);
 $lasso->signal_connect (ended => sub { some_code() });
 $lasso->start ($event);

=head1 OBJECT HIERARCHY

C<Gtk2::Ex::Lasso> is a subclass of C<Glib::Object>.

    Glib::Object
      Gtk2::Ex::Lasso

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A C<Gtk2::Ex::Lasso> object implements a "lasso" style user selection of a
rectangular region in a widget window, drawing dashed lines as visual
feedback while selecting.

        +-------------------------+
        |                         |
        |   +-----------+         |
        |   |           |         |
        |   |           |         |
        |   +-----------*         |
        |                \mouse   |
        |                         |
        |                         |
        +-------------------------+

The lasso is activated by the C<start> function (see L</FUNCTIONS> below),
normally called from a button press or keypress event handler.  When started
from a button the lasso is active while the button is held down, ie. a drag.
This is usual, but it can also begin from a keypress or even something
strange like a menu entry.

The following keys are recognised while lassoing,

    Return      end selection
    Esc         abort the selection
    Space       swap the mouse pointer to the opposite corner

Other keys are propagated to normal processing.  The space to "swap" lets
you move the initial corner if you didn't start at the right spot or change
your mind.  (This swap is only possible in Gtk 2.8 and up.)

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=over 4

=item C<< Gtk2::Ex::Lasso->new (key => value, ...) >>

Create and return a new Lasso object.  Optional key/value pairs set initial
properties as per C<< Glib::Object->new >>.  Eg.

    my $ch = Gtk2::Ex::Lasso->new (widget => $widget);

=item C<< $lasso->start () >>

=item C<< $lasso->start ($event) >>

Start a lasso selection with C<$lasso>.  If C<$event> is a
C<Gtk2::Gdk::Event::Button> then releasing that button ends the selection.
For other event types or for C<undef> or omitted the selection ends only
with the Return key or an C<end> call.

=item C<< $lasso->end () >>

=item C<< $lasso->end ($event) >>

End the C<$lasso> selection and emit the C<ended> signal, or if C<$lasso> is
already inactive then do nothing.  This is the user Return key or button
release.

If you end a lasso in response to a button release, another button press, a
motion notify, or similar, then pass the C<Gtk2::Gdk::Event> as the optional
C<$event> parameter so that C<end> can use it for a final X,Y position and
for a server timestamp if ungrabbing.  Both are important if event
processing in the client is slow for any reason.

=item C<< $lasso->abort () >>

Abort the C<$lasso> selection and emit the C<aborted> signal, or if
C<$lasso> is already inactive then do nothing.  This is the user Esc key.

=item C<< $lasso->swap_corners() >>

Swap the mouse pointer to the opposite corner of the selection by a "warp"
of the pointer (ie. a forcible movement).  This is the user Space key.

For Gtk 2.6 and earlier there's no warp available and currently this method
does nothing there.

=back

=head1 PROPERTIES

=over 4

=item C<widget> (a C<Gtk2::Widget> or C<undef>)

The target widget to act on.  This can be changed to act on a different
widget.  It works even when the lasso is active, though changing while
active stands a good chance of confusing the user.

=item C<active> (boolean, default false)

True while lasso selection is in progress.  Turning this on or off is the
same as calling C<start> or C<end> above (except you can't pass events).

=item C<foreground> (scalar, default C<undef>)

=item C<foreground-name> (string, default C<undef>)

=item C<foreground-gdk> (C<Gtk2::Gdk::Color> object, default C<undef>)

The colour for the lasso.  This can be

=over 4

=item *

C<undef> (the default) for the widget style C<fg> foreground colour (see
L<Gtk2::Style>).

=item *

A string colour name or #RGB form per C<< Gtk2::Gdk::Color->parse >> (see
L<Gtk2::Gdk::Color>).

=item *

A C<Gtk2::Gdk::Color> object with C<red>, C<green>, C<blue> fields set.
(A pixel value is looked up for the widget in use.)

=back

All three C<foreground>, C<foreground-name> and C<foreground-gdk> access the
same underlying setting.  C<foreground-name> and C<foreground-gdk> exist for
use with C<Gtk2::Builder> where the generic scalar C<foreground> property
can't be set.

In the current code, if the foreground is a C<Gtk2::Gdk::Color> object then
C<foreground-name> reads as its C<to_string> like "#11112222333", or if
foreground is a string name then C<foreground-gdk> reads as parsed to a
C<Gtk2::Gdk::Color>.  Is this a good idea?  Perhaps it will change in the
future.

=item C<cursor> (scalar, default "hand1")

=item C<cursor-name> (string, cursor enum nick or "invisible", default "hand1")

=item C<cursor-object> (C<Gtk2::Gdk::Cursor>)

The mouse cursor type to display while lassoing.  This can be any string or
object understood by C<Gtk2::Ex::WidgetCursor>, or C<undef> for no cursor
change.

A different cursor is highly desirable because when starting a lasso it's
normally too small for the user to see and so really needs another visual
indication that selection has begun.  The default C<"hand1"> is meant to be
reasonable.

The C<cursor-name> and C<cursor-object> properties access the same
underlying C<cursor> setting but with string or cursor object type
respectively.  They can be used from a C<Gtk2::Builder> specification.

If using a C<Gtk2::Gdk::Cursor> object remember that cursor objects are a
per-display resource and it must be on the same display as the target
C<widget>.

The cursor can be changed while the lasso is active.  Doing so is probably
unusual but works and might be used for something creative like further
visual feedback or maybe keeping an arrow outwards so as not to obscure the
selected region.

=back

=head1 SIGNALS

=over 4

=item C<moved>, parameters: lasso, x1, y1, x2, y2, userdata

Emitted whenever the in-progress selected region changes (but not when it
ends).  x2,y2 is the corner with the mouse.

=item C<ended>, parameters: lasso, x1, y1, x2, y2, userdata

Emitted when a selection is complete and accepted by the user (not when
aborted).  x2,y2 is the corner where the mouse finished, though it's unusual
to care which way around the corners are.

=item C<aborted>, parameters: lasso, userdata

Emitted when a region selection ends by the user aborting, which normally
means no action on any region.

=back

=head1 BUILDABLE

Lasso can be created from C<Gtk2::Builder> the same as other objects.  The
class name is C<Gtk2__Ex__Lasso> and it will normally be a top-level object
with the C<widget> property telling it what to act on.

    <object class="Gtk2__Ex__Lasso" id="mylasso">
      <property name="widget">drawingwidget</property>
      <property name="foreground-name">orange</property>
      <property name="cursor-name">umbrella</property>
      <signal name="ended" handler="do_lasso_ended"/>
    </object>

The C<foreground-name> property is the best way to control the colour.  The
generic C<foreground> can't be used because it's a Perl scalar type.  The
C<foreground-gdk> works since C<Gtk2::Builder> knows how to parse a colour
name to a C<Gtk2::Gdk::Color> object, but the Builder also allocates a pixel
in the default colormap, which is unnecessary as the Lasso will do that
itself on the target widget's colormap.

The C<cursor-name> property is similarly the best way to control the mouse
cursor type, if the default hand is not wanted.  The generic C<cursor>
property can't be used because it's a Perl scalar type.  The
C<cursor-object> probably can't be used since the Builder doesn't support
cursor creation (as of Gtk circa 2.16).

=head1 OTHER NOTES

The lasso is drawn using xors in the widget window.  See L<Gtk2::Ex::Xor>
for notes on this.

Keypresses are obtained from the Gtk "snooper" mechanism, so they work even
if the lasso target widget doesn't have the focus.  Keys not for the lasso
are propagated in the usual way.

When the lasso is started from a keypress etc, not a button drag, an
explicit pointer grab is used so motion events outside the widget window are
seen.  In the current code a further C<start> call with a button press event
will switch to drag mode, so the corresponding release has the expected
effect.  But perhaps that's a bit obscure, so maybe in the future this will
change.
