This is a couple widget add-ons,

* Gtk2::Ex::CrossHair -- horizontal and vertical lines as a visual guide

* Gtk2::Ex::Lasso -- user selection of a rectangular area

The common feature, and the reason for the dist name is that they draw
with an XOR on top of the ordinary contents of the their target
widget(s).

The prerequisites are Gtk2-Perl and my Glib-Ex-ObjectBits stuff.
